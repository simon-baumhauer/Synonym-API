  address and statistics of current and old orders from the customer. The information saved here is used when new 
  orders for this customer are added.

<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>
  The orders section contains a list of current orders which are not completed or cancled. The color of the list entry 
  indicates if the order is already payed and only needs to be send to the customer (green) or if the order has not been 
  payed by customer (red). By clicking on an order one gets more details and also the possibilty to confirm the payment 
  or send the order of cause depending on the permissions of user currently loggin in the app.
</p>

<h2>Archive</h2>
<p>
  The archive contains a list of all completed or cancled orders. By clicking on the order one can again see more details
  but it is not possible to change any information of the order. A user with admin permissions can delete an order from 
  the archive and thus removing it completely from the backend database.
